Data Science Bootcamp - first project

# Thesis
# Starting one's own brewery is as easy as an API connection. Jk. Once we started exploring the data we had to change our thesis. 
Activity within the brewing industry will organize into routine consumer behaviors and preferences that will provide market research insights for a Brew Crew aka Brewery entrepreneurs.

2. Styles: 
     - Are organic options available?
     
     YES! The North American styles category presented the most organic options. This conclusion required accessing and merging two dictionaries within the API -- Styles and Beers -- and simplying this new data from to contain only the Category (which I called Super Style), Style and Organic (Y/N) indicator for the style. The most challenging part of this clean up was being able to manipulate single-style findings reporting to multiple indexes. 
     
     
       
     - Which styles of beers are within a binned range of abv?
     
3. How does the established date of a brewery correlate to its distance from Chicago?
     - Presented by Becky!
     - We expect that the brewerys closer to Chicago will be older, if trends from history are still present.
